I want to create a website that could be used by tree care professionals to keep and maintain a database of all their customers, clients, or municipal trees.  The site will take in info about the trees and parse the data in whatever way the user wants.

Some of the features will include:
-Tree name (common and scientific)
-Tree feautres such as approximate height, diameter, and root spread
-a place for the user to input a picture of the tree
-Recent activity or actions done to the tree that could include prune, removal, stump grinding, injection, planting
-date of work done on tree 

All the data that is input by a user could then be used to find trends and to sort based on any number of options.
